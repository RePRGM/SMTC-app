    <h1>Why going to class<br/><span>isn’t making you better</span></h1>

    <p>
      This might sound uncomfortable — but most dancers already know it’s true.
      You go to class. You go to socials. You go to festivals. You dance a lot.
      And yet… something still feels missing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your timing feels inconsistent. Certain accents never quite land.
      You know when someone else looks clean — but you can’t always explain why you don’t.
    </p>

    <h2>The problem isn’t effort.</h2>
    <p>The problem is <strong>how</strong> you’re practicing.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        Classes are for learning choreography.<br/>
        Socials are for expression and connection.<br/>
        Festivals are for inspiration.
      </p>
      <p><strong>None of those are designed for deliberate practice.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Most dancers don’t know what to practice</h2>
    <p>
      You know you <em>should</em> practice — but practice what?
      The whole song? The whole routine? Just dancing more?
    </p>
    <p>
      Real improvement happens in the details:
      the 8-count where the groove changes,
      the accent you keep missing,
      the transition that feels rushed.
    </p>

    <h2>This app exists to fix that gap</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t a choreography app. It’s not a class replacement.
      It’s a training tool for dancers who want to <strong>practice with intention</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        Mark the exact moment you want to work on.<br/>
        Loop it without breaking flow.<br/>
        Slow it down to understand it.<br/>
        Speed it back up to own it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      It turns vague practice into focused reps.
      It turns musical awareness into muscle memory.
      It gives you a clear answer to “what should I practice today?”
    </p>

    <h2>Built from real frustration</h2>
    <p>
      Show Me the Counts exists because writing timestamps in Notes and scrubbing through Spotify is ridiculous —
      but it’s what dancers have been forced to do for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the missing layer between class and the dance floor.
    </p>
